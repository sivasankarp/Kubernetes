The kube-proxy is the network agent which runs on each node, control plane and workers, responsible for dynamic updates and maintenance of all networking rules on the node. 
It abstracts the details of Pods networking and forwards connection requests to the containers in the Pods. 

The kube-proxy is responsible for TCP, UDP, and SCTP stream forwarding or random forwarding across a set of Pod backends of an application,
and it implements forwarding rules defined by users through Service API objects.
