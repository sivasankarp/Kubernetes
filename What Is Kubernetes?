According to the Kubernetes website,

"Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications".


Kubernetes is also referred to as k8s (pronounced Kate's), as there are 8 characters between k and s.

Kubernetes is highly inspired by the Google Borg system, a container and workload orchestrator for its global operations for more than a decade. It is an open source project written in the Go language and licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
