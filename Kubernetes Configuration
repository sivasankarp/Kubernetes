Kubernetes can be installed using different cluster configurations. The major installation types are described below:

- All-in-One Single-Node Installation
In this setup, all the control plane and worker components are installed and running on a single-node. 
While it is useful for learning, development, and testing, it is not recommended for production purposes.
- Single-Control Plane and Multi-Worker Installation
In this setup, we have a single-control plane node running a stacked etcd instance. Multiple worker nodes can be managed by the control plane node.
- Single-Control Plane with Single-Node etcd, and Multi-Worker Installation
In this setup, we have a single-control plane node with an external etcd instance. Multiple worker nodes can be managed by the control plane node.
- Multi-Control Plane and Multi-Worker Installation
In this setup, we have multiple control plane nodes configured for High-Availability (HA), with each control plane node running a stacked etcd instance.
The etcd instances are also configured in an HA etcd cluster and multiple worker nodes can be managed by the HA control plane.
- Multi-Control Plane with Multi-Node etcd, and Multi-Worker Installation
In this setup, we have multiple control plane nodes configured in HA mode, with each control plane node paired with an external etcd instance. 
The external etcd instances are also configured in an HA etcd cluster, and multiple worker nodes can be managed by the HA control plane. 
This is the most advanced cluster configuration recommended for production environments.
